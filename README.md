## Overview

This project is based on the recently concluded **ICPR challenge** organized by the **[IP Lab](https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/)** at the **University of Catania**, led by **Dr. F. Guarnera** and **Dr. A. Rondinella**. The challenge introduced a **carefully curated** and **refined dataset** of **brain MRI scans** from patients diagnosed with various forms of **Multiple Sclerosis**. All patients are from the city of **Catania**; however, the scans were acquired using **different MRI machines** across **multiple hospitals**, introducing valuable **inter-scanner variability**.

The primary objectives of the challenge were twofold: to contribute a **novel**, **versatile dataset** to the **research community** and to **benchmark** the performance of **state-of-the-art (SOTA) models**. Participants were encouraged to explore **advanced strategies** such as **sophisticated preprocessing pipelines**, **variations in image registration spaces**, and **ensemble methods** involving **independently trained models**.

You may find the **published paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07924)** and the **challengeâ€™s homepage [here](https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/mfs/ms-les-seg/)**.
