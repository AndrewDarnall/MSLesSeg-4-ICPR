# Weights and Biases Setup

Before you may start the training, you must register an account with [`weights and biases`](https://wandb.ai/site/) or choose a different logger.

After registering an account you must

1) Create a new `team`
2) Create a new `project`
3) Register a new `API` key with your project

Then you must

1) Create a `.env` file
2) Store the `API` key in the `.env` file with the variable name `WANDB_API_KEY=`

And now you may run the experiments on the `notebook`
